# 🧑‍💻 Training_2026 – Internship Learning Repository

This repository is created as part of my **internship training program (2026)**.  
It contains practice exercises, learning modules, and hands-on coding tasks focused on building strong fundamentals in:

- Logic Building
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript
- SQL Queries
- Rust learning
---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

- Practice core programming concepts  
- Improve problem-solving skills  
- Learn frontend basics  
- Understand JavaScript fundamentals  
- Gain hands-on experience with SQL
- Practice on rust concept with help of program   
- Maintain organized internship work  

This repo acts as my **daily training workspace**.

### 🔹 _1_ rust_practice

This repository contains my Rust learning programs organized into three main topics:

1. Loops
2. Structures
3. Serialization & Deserialization (Serde)

These programs are created for practice and understanding Rust fundamentals step-by-step.

---

## 1.1. Loops

This program demonstrates Rust looping concepts.

### Covered Topics

- `loop`
- `while`
- `for`
- Iterating arrays
- `break` and `continue`


---
## 1.2. Structure

This program focuses on Rust structs and methods.

### Covered Topics

- Creating structs
- Initializing values
- Mutable structures
- Getter & setter methods
- `impl` blocks
- Working with complex structures

## 1.3. Serde

This program demonstrates converting Rust structs to JSON and back.

### Concepts

- Serialization (Rust → JSON)

- Deserialization (JSON → Rust)

- Direct method

- Raw JSON method

--- 

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- SQL
- RUST
