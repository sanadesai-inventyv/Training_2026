# 🦀 Rust Inventory Management System  
### (Using Generics, Lifetimes, Traits & Closures)

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project implements a **Generic Inventory Management System** in Rust.  
It demonstrates important Rust concepts including:

- Generics
- Traits
- Lifetimes (Borrowing instead of Ownership)
- Closures
- Custom Error Handling
- HashMap Collection

The inventory stores references to items instead of owning them, making it a lifetime-based design.

## 🧠 Concepts Used
---

This project demonstrates how Rust combines:

- Generics

- Traits

- Lifetimes

- Closures

to create a memory-safe and flexible inventory system without garbage collection.
