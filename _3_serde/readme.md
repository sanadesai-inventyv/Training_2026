# Rust Serialization & Deserialization (Serde Practice)

This project demonstrates how to use **Serde** in Rust to perform:

- Serialization (Struct → JSON)
- Deserialization (JSON → Struct)

Both **direct method** and **raw JSON method** are practiced using a complex structure.

This is created for learning Rust structures and Serde concepts.
